# SAURIA-Cheshire Demo

This repository contains a demonstration of the integration of the SAURIA convolutional accelerator and CHESHIRE MCU. The project includes source code, hardware design files, and supporting scripts for simulation and FPGA deployment.

## Project Structure

- **`hw/`**: Hardware design files, including SystemVerilog modules and packages.
  - `axi_intfc_bridge.sv`, `axi_lite_intfc_bridge.sv`, `sauria_demo_soc.sv`: Core hardware modules.
  - `include/`: Contains reusable hardware packages like `sauria_demo_pkg.sv`.

- **`sw/`**: Software components for the SoC.
  - `data/`: Input, weight, and output tensor data files.
  - `lib/`: Utility libraries and headers for software development.
  - `src/`: Source files for software applications.

- **`target/`**: Target-specific files for FPGA and simulation.
  - `fpga/`: FPGA-related files.
  - `sim/`: Simulation files, including source and ModelSim configurations.

- **`vendor/`**: Dependencies and submodules.
  - `cheshire/`: Cheshire-related files.
  - `SAURIA/`: SAURIA-related files.

- **Root Files**:
  - `.gitignore`: Git ignore rules.
  - `Bender.yml`: Dependency management configuration.
  - `Makefile`: Build automation script.
  - `README.md`: Project documentation.
  - `sauria_demo.mk`: Makefile for the SAURIA demo.

## Getting Started

1. Set-up the project, allowing Bender to update the project's dependecies:
   ```bash
   make set-up
   ```

2. Build the hardware model:
   ```bash
   make hw-all
   ```

3. Build the software:
   ```bash
   make sw
   ```

4. Simulate SAURIA-CHESIRE demo, in two ways:
  - Using ```make sim-gui BIN_SEL=$BIN_SEL```, with $BIN_SEL equal to _0_ for the _Hello world_ example, _1_ for a _register & SRAM_ write & read test, _2_ for a complete _single convolutional layer_ test [WORK IN PROGRESS]
  - Sourcing *start.sauria_demo.tcl* using QuestaSim opened in target/sim/vsim, and setting the BIN_SEL before calling the tcl script
